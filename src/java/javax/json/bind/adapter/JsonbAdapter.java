/**
 * <p>Allows to define custom mapping for given java type. The target type could be string or some
 * mappable java type.</p>
 *
 * <p>On serialization "Original" type is converted into "Adapted" type. After that "Adapted" type is serialized to
 * JSON the standard way.</p>
 *
 * <p>On deserialization it works the reverse way: JSON data are deserialized into "Adapted" type which is converted
 * to "Original" type after that.</p>
 *
 * <p>Adapters are registered using {@link javax.json.bind.JsonbConfig#withAdapters(JsonbAdapter[])} method
 * or using {@link javax.json.bind.annotation.JsonbTypeAdapter} annotation on class field.</p>
 *
 * @param <Original> The type that JSONB doesn't know how to handle
 * @param <Adapted> The type that JSONB knows how to handle out of the box
 *
 * <p>Adapter runtime "Original" and "Adapted" generic types are inferred from subclassing information,
 * which is mandatory for adapter to work.</p>
 *
 * <p>Sample 1:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *      // Generic information is provided by subclassing.
 *      class BoxToCrateAdapter implements JsonbAdapter<Box<Integer>, Crate<String>> {...};
 *      jsonbConfig.withAdapters(new BoxToCrateAdapter());
 *
 *      // Generic information is provided by subclassing with anonymous class
 *      jsonbConfig.withAdapters(new JsonbAdapter<Box<Integer>, Crate<String>> {...});
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Sample 2:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *      BoxToCrateAdapter<T> implements JsonbAdapter<Box<T>, Integer<T>> {...};
 *
 *      // Bad way: Generic type information is lost due to type erasure
 *      jsonbConfig.withAdapters(new BoxToCrateAdapter<Integer>());
 *
 *      // Proper way: Anonymous class holds generic type information
 *      jsonbConfig.withAdapters(new BoxToCrateAdapter<Integer>(){});
 * }
 * </pre>
